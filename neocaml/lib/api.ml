(* Build a post request to server for loginðŸ¥µ.
 * See: https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/blob/master/nio/api.py
 * line 305, def login. Need to decide whether I really want to break this
 * in to Api and Client modules where so much is shared, or jsut have a client
 * module. For example, login in the nio api.py and login in async_client.py
 * https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/blob/master/nio/client/async_client.py
 * are almost the same. The client simply sends it and basically passes along
 * all of it's arguments. Should I follow the same pattern, or not? *)
